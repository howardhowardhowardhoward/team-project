 * INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION - DealerAction use case not implemented
 * TODO: Implement dealer's automatic play logic
 *
 * Expected functionality:
 * - Dealer draws cards until reaching 17 or higher
 * - Handle bust scenarios
 * - Determine winner and update balance
 *
 * Note: Some dealer logic exists in Dealer.play() method
 * This interactor should coordinate that with game state

# Team Project

This project is all about a functional blackjack game.

The idea is to keep the design simple but effective in coding with clean architecture and design principles. The game has a 
start page where users can either click 'start game' or 'exit'. After that the user can place a deal using the chips available and can choose 
to make a deal. Making a deal will take the user to a new page where the game can be played. 

Inside this page, there is a dealer and the player, each with two cards. One of the dealer cards is hidden. The total points of visible cards
is shown along side the dealer and the player. the total balance that will update the  as we play, is shown in the screen. 

At the start of the game, the player can choose either to hit, stand and double. HE can coutinue to do so until he busts (crosses 21). If the 
player busts, the dealer wins and his balance is deducted. if he doesnt burst, then the dealer takes its turn, and can either bust or stop at above 17. 
The player who has th highest score without busting wins. 

Note: The reason why "HarryMaguire" has so many commits is because he made a lot of unnecessary commits when trying to reorganize the files. As a result, the number is heavily inflated.
